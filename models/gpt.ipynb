I havent been diagnosed with ocd as everyone even professionals pass it off as obsessional thinking and not ocd. Recently for about 4 months straight now ive had no break from intrusive thoughts. They are about if im a psychopath narcissist sociopath sadist pedophile or the next serial killer. I wouldnt leave the house and i still wont because i know because i start to think more when i do. Last year i developed the fear of being schizophrenic or psychotic. Id start panicking thinking am i delusional or if i hear something whilst listening to music id have to rewind the music back and listen again just to check i was sane. I started imagining voices in my head to convince myself i could actually hear them. When id leave the house my mind would be like \" youre being watched\" or \"that person over there is a witch\" etc etc. \\n     \\nDay before yesterday i was talking to someone about how i wouldnt smoke weed because i dont want to be psychotic or end up schizo. And then i remembered how they have delusions and think crazy stuff(no offence). And then i had a thought i cant remember if it started with \"what if\" but anyways it was something like \" what if my parents arent my real parents and to have my real parents back i have to kill the ones im with now and then they will come and we will be together happily\" and now i wish i never even spoke about psychosis because ive made myself latch onto another thing. But now im like am i just saying that so i can convince myself im sane.\\n\\nYesterday i tried thinking rationally by looking at photos from when i was born and i will keep telling myself if they arent my real parents explain this but then id think yeah but what if they adopted me or took me when i was born. And then i keep telling myself my dad is my real dad and my mum is my real mum but im still not convinced and i actually think im being delusional but then im like what if im not delusional and im just saying that to seem sane and what if i am right that they arent my real parents.\\n\\nAnd yesterday i kept looking at my dad and thinking oh my real dad wouldnt say that or see thats not my dad but at the same time im trying to convince myself it is and ive never once questioned if they were my parents until about 2 days ago when i was talking about schizophrenia. Or im just making excuses to cover up that im insane. But when i say im delusional i dont feel delusional i feel like im right and am just saying it to convince myself im sane.\\n\\nI keep imaging in my head like to test myself ways to kill my parents and how i will then message their phone numbers and write a message saying for them both to meet me down my street and then we meet and we live happily ever after. Its like im testing myself by imagining these things to see how i react and if they sound right. Like i kept thinking my dad isnt my dad to see if it sounded right and it did and then i said my dad is my real dad and now that dont sound right.\\n\\nThese few months i did convince myself i had a list of disorders and that im a future serial killer and i had these intrusive thoughts for months. I have other things that i think make me delusional and thats i used to or still do sometimes imagine i have super powers but then im like but i do have super powers. And now im like its psychosis and then i think no its not its the truth.\\n\\nIm on anti depressants so i looked up if they caused delusions and my dad has mental health disorders but idk if ive got something from him. And then i looked up the thing im thinking and it came up with something called a capgras delusion and i was like oh great so i have that.\\n\\nIts like now im comvinced they arent my real parents and now nothing feels right anymore and idk what to do and i tell myself delusional people wouldnt question this stuff but im not sure. And i feel like im saying things to sound sane when im actually not or there is nothing wrong with me and what i think i the truth. I keep thinking ah well that explains alot that my dad isnt my real dad because my real dad would be so much nicer and same for my mum and then im like they arent my real parents so in order to have them back i must kill these ones now.\\n\\nI did once drive myself mad thinking i had depersonalization or something. So id be standing in the mirror and i will look at think how is that me? Thats someone else surely? And then i also convinced myself ive been faking my feelings the whole time and im emotionless and that i dont love my parents and it made me cry because i told my dad and he was like its fine if you dont love us but we love you and then i felt guilty. That drove me mad to the point where i wanted to be put in hospital because i was panicking and kept thinking every emotion i felt was false the whole time.\\n\\nI sometimes think oh what if ted bundy is my cat but reincarnated or something like that. Or if its a person stuck in the cat. And yesterday i was sat thinking that my dad doesnt have a clue what his daughter is thinking right now that he isnt her dad. Idk what to do because ive convinced myself its true and that they arent my real parents so i have capgras syndrome or im just lying to myself that its capgras and im covering up the truth to make me feel sane which sounds more right than the other thing.', \"I am kinda nervous I don't know what to expect. Does anyone have any advice?\", 'Can different personalities have different sexual preferences?', 'Dear mom,\\n\\nThere’s so much I’d like to tell you. So much I want to fill you in on. My achievements, my struggles. I sorta wish you were around so I could. When I first left I used to cry myself to sleep every night because I truly thought I was a horrible daughter, maybe a part of me still does. I think about my childhood a lot and what it was like growing up with you. I think early on my life was good, from what I can remember at least. I remember you loving me. I wonder when that started to change. The first memory I have of the start of what I can only call your hatred towards me was around the age of 6. I remember all the names you used to call me, how you used to say you could’ve never wished for a better daughter in that snarky, sarcastic tone you use. I remember when you’d call me fat and how you’d tell me nobody would ever love me because of my body. I was 8 when I tried to kill myself. I don’t think you ever knew.. or maybe you did and just didn’t care enough to bring it up. I remember when you got me my cat. my sweet little man! he did more for me than you ever could. I remember you screaming at me - inches away from my face. Getting belittled, spit on, beat. You broke whatever spirit I had in me. I remember you doing drugs in front of me, bringing strangers (men) into our house. You did that to me for years. My first year of high school I skipped a lot, and I regret it completely. however, taking me out of school and isolating me completely was unfair. At the time I thought it was cool as fuck that you’d buy me alcohol and weed. I now know that that was just another way of you being a shitty parent. I was 15 when you had your best friend babysit me because i couldn’t “be trusted” alone in the house. We drank and smoke.. and drank some more. He assaulted me that night. When you found out, you stayed friends with him. You told me to keep my legs closed. The only reason you stopped being friends with him is because he owed you $50 and didn’t pay you back. I guess my well being is worth less than a 50. When you found out I self harming you stormed into my room at 4 am to interrogate me. You asked if I was suicidal, I said no. You believed me for once. Instead of comforting me you started to complain about how much seeing a shrink would cost. You never once took me to get help. I was 16 the first time you let me go out of the house alone, it was for my friends birthday. You still called me every 5 minutes though. I left the day after my 17th birthday. I stayed with my friend for a bit - then my dads. I struggled with my own form of substance abuse and toxic relationships. But here I am now. I’m clean. I started school and i’m all caught up! surprising considering the years I missed. I started job training. I have my boyfriend who I love so dearly. And I did all of that without you. I know you’d say that you’re proud of me and that you’re so lucky to have raised such a great daughter (especially to your friends). But in reality, IM the one who did this. If it makes me a shitty daughter to say that I don’t need my mom, then so be it. Cause right now i’d rather be a shitty daughter than every let you treat me like that again. I’m still learning how to do a lot. Most of which I should already know. But, you never taught me so here I am. It honestly gets easier every day. I had my 18th not too long ago.. A year without you. it’s weird. I miss and love you, I just wished you could’ve been better. If not for me than for yourself.

I pick at the acne on my face, neck, chest, and shoulders constantly even when there isn't any acne there at all. I do it subconsciously and it can often make completing tasks extremely difficult. I do it most when I'm at school and it's so frustrating since it's so gross and it draws attention. And when I look in the mirror for more than around ten seconds, I start to search for anything that i can try to pop and i can't resist the urge almost every time. I often pick at it till I bleed but still continue to do it and I can't seem to stop. It makes my already bad anxiety and self-confidence worse because it leaves big, gross looking scabs everywhere and I have years worth of acne scars. I literally can't go to school without putting makeup on which causes me to be late every day and it costs a lot of money. My self-confidence has improved a lot in the last year or so but this keeps holding me back from fully loving myself and the way I look.

It means I\\'m not starting my new meds until tomorrow now because no way in fuck am I gonna potentially over sleep and miss work, am currently throwing up all of dinner, and going grabbing some vodka from the gas station down the street after. \\nThis is my social support guys.

She didnt really care while I was in the ER or hospital either..... before the session ended she called in my mom and told her all this too my mom was confused to because she was a little rude.

I'm fairly certain that we've narrowed it down to that accurately. It kind of sounds exactly like what it is but as an understatement. For my whole life, I've lived with extreme symptoms of this disorder, and it had actually helped ruin my life, in conjunction with poor choices. The only reason I mention it is because of potential co-morbidity (sp?).  I'm asking this question out of desperation, so please be kind.\\n\\nI am an extremely virtuous person, although I keep most of my intentions and beliefs secret. My avoidance personality disorder involves being constantly terrified of humiliation and rejection. So I don't virtue signal. This is the first time I've tried to put this perspective into words to convey to anyone else. People close to me see that I'm chronically frustrated with thoughtlessness and lack of consideration/respect for others, among other things. I don't feel that I'm better than anyone else or carry more value. Actually, I feel the complete opposite because I've had a very rough past. I have really low self esteem, but I take care of myself and half-heartedly seek out happiness for myself. I do it because I feel like I'm an asset to others. I think that part is somewhat normal for parents to feel that way though.\\n\\nI am FAR from perfect. I curse way too much. Sometimes I attempt to manipulate people, but from my perspective, it's to lead to better,more positive outcomes. I feel like people are just chronic pathological liars and excuse-making machines. I mess up and fail just as much as the next guy.

But, it didn’t hurt me much and I know people have had it much worse. Plus, I actually feel it might have helped me be more obedient. I don’t know, I just wanted to mention that as a detail. Next, she sort of drove me to attempt suicide. I was going through an EXTREMELY hard time in my junior year of high school. I was already suicidal basically without any help from her. But, after another really bad day, she picked me up from school and just immediately began yelling at me because of some stupid math homework I didn’t do. I will concede that I was basically not doing my schoolwork at the time, but this was the stupidest thing to get mad at. I wasn’t in danger of failing math, and my teacher literally gave me a B on a test when I should have gotten a 0. He really wasn’t the type to fail someone. I tried explaining I had a terrible day, and that it wasn’t such a big deal, but she just yelled at me that I never do what I’m supposed to do and that  if I keep this up, I’ll never amount to anything. So, by the time we made it home, I decided I wanted to die and was willing to take action. Next, she always tries to force God on me. I understand she just wants to give me comfort, but she will not stop bringing up religion. We’ll be talking about something, and she always needs to bring up God. I have tried telling her that it doesn’t help but she just never quits. Next, she makes fun of me when we’re with other relatives and has a bad habit of telling relatives things that I don’t want to be known. She says I’m ungrateful because of all the stuff she does for me. But, I don’t know. I know that a tactic by manipulative parents is to say that, but at the same time, you can’t deny there are ungrateful children in the world. Like, my mom always provides for me materially. Sometimes she buys me nice things and what not. But, I would prefer it if she were way nicer but never bought me anything. I know a LOT of people have had it way worse than me in regards to their parents. I’m sure a lot of people on this sub may disregard me entirely when others are being sexually abused and heavily beaten by their parents. Anyway, I really don’t know who is in the wrong.

In the morning I meet with a very nice teacher who understands me and teaches me how I prefer in 3 of my classes. After year 1 of middle school, I was around 3 yrs ahead in Math, 1.5 yrs ahead in Language Arts, and 2 yrs ahead in Biology. As a result of this, once one of my friends told people it went around and everyone was calling me a nerd and I just couldn't understand why. The namecalling just got worse and worse as the days went on in 7th grade, it got to the point where it wasn't name-calling it was shaming for being myself. I couldn't stand it anymore and when one of the kids came around and called my mother a stupid B\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* I punched him as hard as I could and then ran. I don't know why I ran but I did, I guess the stress just took me over. I was called in and since the cameras, don't record audio and they hadn't recorded previous bullying from him. I was sent home and my parents where told that I out of nowhere punched a harmless kid. I was furious since when I got home, my parents actually believed them! I was grounded for the next month, and suspended for a week, during that time I was extremely suicidal as I thought about the future of my life and what I had going for me. During this, I realized I had nothing going for me. I was one of the heaviest kids in my grade despite working out for 1-4 hrs per day. I had no friends to play with, and If I tried making friends they would laugh me off calling me a psychopath. I was short which made it hard to defend myself was relentless bullying. And no one truly understood me or my situation. Since whenever I did something I somehow became the antagonist. I attempted my life 2 times during that but never came to do it because for some reason I thought I needed to live. When I was let back into school the kid who I punched got everyone in the classes that I had with him to hate me and call me names. When the district-wide performance arts concert came around, I had a severe panic attack right before the show in backstage and everyone in the ensembles saw me.

It\\'s not a thrill, it\\'ll probably be a bit boring and long but if you stick through to the end then... I appreciate it, haha.\\n\\nSo about me first; I\\'m a 25 year old male from Australia.\\n\\nI\\'ve struggled with my self esteem and self confidence for as long as I can remember. I recall, as a child, no more than 4 or 5, asking my father if he looked like he does now back when he was a child because I didn\\'t want to look like I did for the rest of my life. That struggle continued through my school years and is still something I have to deal with every single day. It\\'s really the basis for all of my issues with my self worth. Living in a society that puts so much emphasis on our external appearance has a massive impact on me. That side of it is for a different conversation though. That\\'s a long one on it\\'s own.\\n\\nThroughout my high school years I really began to have issues with my self esteem more than I had before. For those who aren\\'t aware, high school in Australia (I know it can vary from state to state but in mine) is usually years 7-12. So ages 12/13-17/18. Around 9th grade (15) I really started hating myself and my appearance. I\\'m about 176cm tall (*roughly* 5\\'9-10\") and 55kg (I think thats about 129lbs??) so I\\'m a pretty small guy and I went to a school that put a lot of emphasis on sport. So seeing strong, buff (for their age) and athletic guys was a real struggle for me. \\n\\nI was kind of in denial about how bad I felt about myself. I confided in one or two female friends and one of them was supportive while the other, probably trying to be, just said it was \"teenage angst\". I\\'ve kind of forgotten a lot about high school with it being so long ago. But I will always remember that that is where my negative thoughts really started festering. I would occasionally cry myself to sleep thinking about how ugly I was. I mean, I still look at myself as ugly now, but in high school I was really bad. I didn\\'t have a good haircut and wore really bad glasses. Around late 9th grade I started growing hair on my chest which most guys would love but I always hated. I started shaving it off even though I never took my shirt off in front of anyone. It was just another thing for me to hate about myself. \\n\\nPlus, being a \\'drama kid\\' I also had to perform in front of the school on a few occasions but that wasn\\'t until year 12 when I got a nic(er) hair cut and didn\\'t look as horrifying, haha. \\n\\nFast forward from 2011 to 2015. The years in between were spent basically feeling the same as I did in high school. Hating my appearance. But it gradually became worse and I started hating myself in general, having really really down days for no discernible reason and just being sad in general. I could hide it well from my family though. It helped that they were always out in the day at work/school and I worked in the evenings so I didn\\'t see them all that much. Side point, I\\'m glossing over a lot here, mostly because I\\'m writing this at 12:30am, I\\'m tired and I\\'m forgetting a lot, haha.\\n\\n In December 2015 I felt like it was getting so bad that I couldn\\'t handle it anymore. I didn\\'t start self harming, though. Instead I did something about how I was feeling. I went to my doctor. She told me that it sounded like I had a chemical imbalance causing my depression and I was having really negative feelings that I couldn\\'t control. She prescribed me some anti-depressants. I know chemical imbalance depression can be controversial but I\\'m not here to discuss that side of it. Anyway, a few days later my family had a really terrible crisis and it put a massive strain on all of us. It made it difficult to know if the medication wasn\\'t working or if I was just genuinely sad. \\n\\nI wish, right now, I could tell you that I was strong and that I never felt the urge to self harm. But that would be a lie. I wish I could tell you that I never succumbed to that urge, that I never hurt myself as a way to deal with the emotional pain, but that would also be a lie. \\n\\nIn 2016 it became so stressful and emotional that, while my family was away for a few days I started hurting myself as a way to let the emotional pain out in a physical way. I didn\\'t do it a lot, but I did a few times over the course of 2016-2017. \\n\\nI felt, so many times over those years, that I couldn\\'t do it. I couldn\\'t keep living. I felt like I hated myself. I *did* hate myself. I felt like I was incredibly ugly. Like people only pretended to like me and that they secretly hated me. I would cry myself to sleep frequently. I saw myself as a failure. That not one single person would miss me if I were to die or run away and never come back. I planned where I would run to, how I would do it and what I would change my name to. I felt like I didn\\'t have any friends. I felt sad almost every day for no reason. I struggled to sleep. I didn\\'t eat much. I barely left the house except for work. I spent what should have been the best years of my life, my late teens-early 20s, hating myself, wanting to die, avoiding people, crying... hurting physically and emotionally... living with a massive secret I haven\\'t told anybody and haven\\'t mentioned here. I would go to bed and pray to God that I die in my sleep. I didn\\'t want to wake up the next morning. I\\'d be sad when I did. \\n\\nI felt like a waste of a human being. \\n\\nNow, in 2018, I\\'m not medicated. I still have days where I am down. I still have days where I hate myself or I feel like people don\\'t really like me and are being nice. I still feel depressed occasionally. I still feel like I\\'m ugly. I live with anxiety. I still have days where I wake up and feel down. \"Today just isn\\'t a happy day.\" \\n\\nBut I\\'m here. I haven\\'t hurt myself in over a year. \\n\\nSome negative thoughts and feelings never go away. I\\'m not going to lie to you. It hurts. It\\'s hard. But it\\'s true. But. If you\\'re ever feeling like you can\\'t get through it. If you\\'re ever feeling overwhelmed with your negative thoughts and feelings. If you ever think you\\'re weak I want you to stop. Stop and tell yourself something. Tell yourself you *are* strong. You *can* do it. You c*an* get thought it. How do I know that? How does someone you\\'ve literally never met know that?\\n\\nWell, you\\'re reading this, aren\\'t you? You\\'ve punched your way through every day.

I slipped into a few depressive episodes about 4 years ago because of some personal things going on in my life, but now I'm just numb to everything. Back then I used to feel every bad thing I was thinking but something's changed. I can smile and laugh when I watch shows or dance a little when I listen to music. But when I'm doing neither of those things I feel incredibly empty and void. There are moments where I'm suddenly hyper aware of myself but at the same time I feel like I don't exist. I've never truly felt alive before, I'm sort of just living in this awkward state of limbo.\\n\\nI know I have huge amounts of empathy but I can't apply it to real people. I play a lot of video games to escape and can feel things for the characters in them but not people in my life, even those who are close to me. I care for them, I know I do, but I'm still so empty. When I listen to music I daydream about living in a completely different reality where I feel happy and content. Sometimes I'll daydream about certain characters from games or movies I like, wishing I could be in their world and not mine (I'm probably a maladaptive daydreamer but I'm not 100% sure). I imagine that they're my friends or family—that they care about me and love me because I don't feel those connections with the people in my life.\\n\\nI have little to no motivation to do most things and looking back I never really did.

I don't have any real friends to talk to about my problems and my family is no different. I've had suicidal thoughts before and also started to self harm, which isn't exactly surprising but I never thought I would get to this point. I'm not even entirely sure why I do it, except for the fact that I want to see myself bleed. Maybe it makes me feel like I'm living but who knows. I've hated myself for so long to the point where I just don't care about anything anymore. I do things because people tell me to do them or if I feel like I have to because it's what everyone else does. I never do what I want for myself if that makes sense. \\n\\nI think what I'm trying to say is that I'm not sure what's wrong with me.

For example, parents got divorced at a young age and it traumatized you, or a few years of school bullying, or an abusive relationship, etc.', 'Hey, this is my first post here. I just needed some insight on this situation.\\n\\nSo I’m in high school one of my best friends (17M) has depression, severe OCD, and severe anxiety. He has dealt with these things for years, and they used to be crippling. In middle school he was suicidal for a time, and was terribly depressed all the way through until after sophomore year. His anxiety and OCD have remained rather severe, but junior year he got on top of his school work and wasn’t nearly as depressed. He’s been coping rather well with things, but recently it’s begun to get way worse. He desperately wants help, has frequent breakdowns, but gets too anxious to talk to anyone except me about this. He’s started mildly self-harming and saying things like he wants to throw himself down the stairs.\\n\\nThe huge problem here and what’s been the problem the whole time is his parents. For context, these folks watch Fox News all day and are borderline Q-Anon level. For years they’ve been overprotective but also clearly invalidating his feelings, as well as dismissing any request for professional help (he’s an only child, by the way). They always denied that he had anything wrong with him, EVEN when he got a doctor’s diagnosis (which by the way was only able to happen relatively recently, despite his years of suffering). These people are out to fucking lunch. Not to mention that they’re rather well off, and make him feel worse about himself with comments like “you have all this stuff, how can you be depressed? You’re being an ungrateful brat” when he voices his troubles. Awful shit. These people have no doubt made everything 10x worse and likely caused much of his illness to begin with.\\n\\nSo obviously we’d love to get professional help for my friend, but his delusional parents make it outright impossible. Every time someone tries to tell them what to do to help their son they shut down and don’t listen.\\n\\nLuckily, friend only has a year or so more of this before he’s 18, and I fully encourage him to get the fuck out of that house, something he’s eager for. They also want to keep him in the house after graduating and commute to a local college. Something he does NOT plan on doing. They just have a frustrating amount of control over his life and we’re worried that even after he’s 18, they’ll have too much financial leverage against him and they’ll prevent him from pursuing what he actually wants to do.\\n\\nWe once tried to talk to the school counselors but they didn’t do shit, they just told his parents and it didn’t go anywhere. It feels like he’s kind of trapped, and there aren’t any ways to help him because he’s underage. And it’s not quite abuse so it’s not like I can call CPS or something. It’s so frustrating to see him suffer like this and to not be able to do anything about his dipshit parents.\\n\\nHis 18th can’t come soon enough, then he’ll finally be able to get his own help. But if it’s getting this bad, we need a more immediate solution or coping mechanism. I can answer any questions.

I sometimes/often feel I’m unloved and inadequate. At one point I had inferiority complex idk if I still do. I compare myself to others and beat myself up and assume others feel the same about me for not being in the same place as them in life, even if I’ve explained to them that I couldn’t because I have a history of mental illness and trauma. I consciously don’t want pity or sympathy as I see them as pointless but my mom says I do so maybe it’s subconscious or something. When I realize I’ve messed up (not on a test but with others) I freak out and get really frustrated at myself. I feel it’s happened so many times that I’m unfixable, that I always ruin everything, all I do is try and fail. She thinks I’m freaking out crying so much because I got caught. Yes it does suck, but as I get older, I become glad to be caught so I can fix it but mostly I freak out realizing how much I messed up, how much worse it could’ve gone, how much I hurt her and others, and seeing how it keeps happening no matter how much I try, so I worry I can never be fixed and I need to die. But I don’t want her to worry so I don’t tell her how I get suicidal ever. After we calm down I ask for reassurance she still wants me around, my company and I never believe her when she says of course. I feel like I need to die, and sometimes wish my mom would kill me and feel she wants to. The other day this happened and I was crying how I screw up everything and she said I was playing victim. That wasn’t exactly my goal I don’t think. My brain had been telling me that a lot and I needed comfort, to be told me dying wouldn’t fix anything for anyone. I know it was inappropriate to seek comfort when I’d fucked up so bad. She said I have a history of being deceitful and I asked for examples, I was being genuine but she had right to believe I was trying to manipulate her. I asked because if I could look back and see times where I’d done wrong, maybe I could fix something. She did give examples. I’ve struggled with a mild restrictive eating disorder, self harm and frequent suicidal episodes for 5 years. I was neglected and abused most of my life by my dad, even as a baby he taught me to be mean to my mom. He never saw me as a human I don’t believe, only something to use against her. His family helped him. As a kid they gaslit and manipulated me to have memories of her abusing me. They ridiculed my allergy to spite my mom. Anything to spite her. They alienated me from her and the neglect continued to get worse until 8th grade when my suicidal episodes and more began. It was really really bad. I had to parent my sister a year younger and I was always angry and hurting. It’s no excuse but I was abusive to her throughout middle school. He turned a blind eye. He was really big and tall and I was a scrawny girl. All he had to do was flex his muscles and I could punch his arms all I wanted he just smirked. Id in his face yelling at him for how he was treating us in 8th grade and he’d gaslight me. In middle school, I would have temper tantrums, throwing my stuff in my room, in 8th grade breaking things and kicking holes in the wall. He teased me for such random things that I’m careful to not let anyone know any of my interests or anything unless I trust them. For the longest time I acted indifferent or like I disliked things I like, sometimes still do especially with my family, even if they like it as well. I hide all my loved things like a rodent, because he used to look through my stuff. Tried to make me show him a fanfic I wrote in seventh grade (nothing nsfw just embarrassing), i ran outside with it and hid it by a neighbors car. I don’t remember if I eventually let him after he threatened to not let me go to my uncles wedding. He played a band I liked one time outside my door I forgot why but it made me so so angry. I couldn’t stand to hear it. If someone like on tiktok says if you listen to this band I don’t trust you, you have poor taste, or whatever I will immediately drop the band. My mom says I change my personality to fit in or stand out. Because I had to try to keep everything together in middle school but always failed, I feel I have to control everything so nothing bad happens but also that I ruin everything. I get anxious from being center of attention but sometimes especially in the past I’ve been attention seeking, which I attribute mainly to my ADHD and history of neglect. I have trouble keeping up with my responsibilities I think because of my ADHD and trauma, and this is understandably extremely stressful for my mom. When she got tired of it I played victim, told half a story and manipulated myself and others to believe she was abusing me. I and my mom don’t believe I consciously manipulated anyone but either way it’s scary. I feel disconnected from reality sometimes, like idk what is true and I can’t trust my memories or anything because people have been putting shit in there and taking shit out since I was a kid. It’s like the gravity turned off and only I’m experiencing the confusion, chaos, disorder but can’t trust what anyone else says they see. I don’t trust my perception of reality, I feel like I’m going insane or something and I don’t even see it. I tried to explain to my mom (just said I don’t trust what I see as reality or something) and she said we all feel unreal sometimes, you need to take care of yourself but I didn’t mean that I feel unreal or have hallucinations. I have had a few in the past though. My mom used to and sometimes still does worry idc about others that I’m trying to sabotage her when I mess up, etc. she says I need to work on my empathy. I probably do need to work on my empathy but I think I care about others and desperately want to avoid causing any harm, even to bugs I don’t like unless it’s a fly or mosquito.

I mainly fear them not believing me.\\n\\nI'm 18f and I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 2014 after having so many panic attacks in a short amount of time and was on the verge of a mental breakdown. Back then I lied on the questionnaire that the nurse handed me (brief anxiety pre-scan) because I was terrified of my mother seeing my results. I bought that everyone could see my answers and would judge me.. I sat there the entire time with it blank until I was called back and filled it out randomly. (The doctor I had then was a family doctor I've had since I was born. Super sweet old man who has always been amazing)\\n\\nFor some more background I'll explain my family situation. I have a 26F sister who had depression and some drug issues and is now better in both regards. My 16year old sibling has schizophrenia, depression, autism, ADHD, and anxiety. Then I have a 6m brother who is on the autism spectrum. With all of us having mental issues I was the caretaker as my parents both worked full time. \\n\\nI was the independent one and as such my parents relied on me for everything to do with keeping the house and family together. I cleaned, cooked, and watched my younger siblings. As such I didn't want to burden my family by hanging out with friends, or joining clubs and sports. \\n\\nWith the responsibility I had to my family schools was put on the back burner with it all of my mental problems. \\n\\nI was always telling my family that I was fine and that everything was okay. I eventually started to believe it and for me that worked for a long time. \\n\\nMore recently I've been starting to piece together things that I never understood about myself. One example being that in a situation that makes me nervous I will say things that I don't 'mean' for lack of a better word. Even though I'm completely conscious I can't speak or choose my words. They just come out of my mouth out of nowhere. It feels similar to my panic attacks where I have this out of body experience and I can't control anything. \\n\\nWith this I have really mad mood and energy swings. To where one hour I'll be so high energy and then the next I can't even be bothered to lift a finger to even get food if I'm hungry. \\n\\nI don't know how to talk to this newer doctor about these things and how to even bring it up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\nFor some extra information. My mother is the one who sets up all my appointments and I have to go to my general doctor for a recommendation before I can go to a specialist.\", 'Alright. Had some pretty ptsd type occurrences the last couple years, most recently being the worst. So after that, I never truly got over it cause I didn’t even know how it affected me or how much. Not. Good. Bad place mentally, and my drug addiction kicks full swing. Hardest of the hard. Woulda made ‘D.A.R.E.’ worried type shit. Awake weeks at a time. No sleep. Barely ate. Then would crash out on a downer. ODed. Near deaths. Not only myself but people in the room with me. A friend, a couple. Brought back to the living because of nothing more than my experience with a horrible childhood/life. Do you know how to bring someone back that has oded on heroin to the point of reflex? Mentally it was bad enough the thought of the release of death seemed like a fantasy. Serious shit. Well recently had a breakdown. Happened 6 months back and just again. Like I’m waking up. My consciousness breaking thru to reality. Realizing how bad the drug use, depression, dissociative personality really is. Like watching my life happen thru a screen knowing I’m not controlling my self. Like someone took over and I can’t stop it. Not that I felt that way the whole time. Just that the memory of the feeling of not Being in control and feeling someone else is. Hard to explain. Like emotion and feelings and sadness take over, my life goes to shit, then I snap back to myself by smoking a little weed. Sounds dumb but it’s like my refresh button. I realize what I’m doing. That I’m out of control and change. For a few months. Drug induced psychosis it feels like with a little bipolar and  a little depression. Split personality maybe ? Help', 'I’ve struggled with bad anxiety off and on since I was 17. I’ve started a new chapter in my life but I graduated with a BA in history which doesn’t give you a set job after graduation. I still don’t know what to do and my anxiety has started to get worse over the past 2 days because college has been all I’ve known for the past 5 years and I’ve had a family that has supported me financially during my educational endeavors but I’m not sure how much more they’ll help. I’ve been somewhat sheltered over my life and I’m so scared of the future because I’ve never been out in the real world. My anxiety has been so bad that I worry about my health when it’s not founded in reality and it’s so bad that I can’t fly on a plane or drive on the interstate because I’m afraid something bad will happen to me. I’m so scared of the future and of the unknown. It’s different from when I graduated high school because I knew what I was doing but now I don’t know and my sheltered life is about to get a nice dose of reality.', 'I’m middle-aged and have always had some kind of sensory disorder, specifically about touch. Think “can’t stand socks with seams on the toes” but much much more. When I was really young and adults would put on my jacket, and it would make my long sleeves bunch up, it was sort of the touch equivalent of hearing nails on a chalkboard.\\n\\nIt hasn’t gotten better. I can’t wear tight socks or tights because it pushes my toes into touching. I can’t put my hands in “prayer” position at the end of yoga because it’s so uncomfortable to have my palms touching. I can’t snap my fingers because it’s too uncomfortable. I’m constantly adjusting my bra strap or my backpack strap. Sometimes I don’t even like the feeling of my eyelids on my eyeballs.\\n\\nNONE of this is pain. It’s all just…, uncomfortable… and I don’t know how to describe it. I can’t “sit with it,” the anxiety and discomfort just gets higher.\\n\\nMy psychiatrist has no idea and just keep saying “we usually only see this in autistic people.” I am not autistic and I don’t have ADHD but I do have complex PTSD from very early childhood abuse, so I‘m guessing that’s where it comes from.\\n\\nAny coping techniques? I’m just so very very tired.', \"I've noticed a trending pattern in myself/my energy levels. I periods where I feel super up, like I can do and accomplish anything, I start making goals and plans etc and I feel super motivated and it genuinely shows in both my personal and home life. Then I have a super hard crash where I feel almost suicidal low, can barely get myself out of bed, I can still manage to get myself up for work and I'm able to hold jobs down but you can tell that I go from 100% to barely pushing 15% over night- all my plans and goals go from seeming right in the palm of my hand to feeling a million light years away and all I want to do is sleep. During these down episodes though, one of the few things that gets me up is needing to take care of my cat, feed him, check his water, etc. It's so small but it helps get me going for the day even if I still feel like I'm moving through molasses. I have no one but him, he's the only one who sees my struggle behind closed doors and he's still here- maybe not entirely by choice haha, but it's like he knows when I'm at my low points and he makes it a point to come lay with me, almost like he's telling me it's okay, and I'll have a down day with you.\", 'Hello everyone,\\n\\nI am creator of \"Getbetter. io\" app, which I  posted about here some time ago.

But if you can read to the end, I’d appreciate it. I apologize in advance for any grammar or spelling mistakes or typos and autocorrects. Just don’t really have the spoons to proofread this and I was kinda just typing out my thoughts. \\nI have a fairly good life. I’ve been going through some hard times lately (assault, my girlfriend broke up with me) but other than that, my life is ok. I don’t live with my toxic parents anymore, I have a great best friend who cares about me, I have an adorable non-bio niece, I have a job in the field I’m majoring in (education) and the students I work with (K-2) love me and are making progress, I have a good church with people who care about me and affirm me as a gay woman. I don’t really believe in god anymore but I stay for the community I found there of Christians who don’t suck. I have so much to be happy for, but I’m not. In fact, ever since I was 12 (I’m 23), I’ve had a longing to die. I’ve had several near suicide attempts and I think about death and suicide daily. I hate living. I hate feeling. I hate not feeling. I hate myself and I feel like everyone couldn’t care less about me anyway. I feel like people get annoyed with me and just put on a happy face and are nice to me out of obligation. I’ve lived with depression and anxiety for 11 years and anorexia for 8 but was not diagnosed until recently. My parents refused to take me to a doctor in high school and I didn’t reach out for help until a year ago. My old therapist didn’t really help much and she didn’t have enough availability for me to see her as often as I needed. My current therapist diagnosed me with PTSD, depression, and anorexia. It’s nice to have a name to the anxiety that’s literally never turned off but I hate hearing “PTSD”. I don’t like having it attached to me. I’m trying to do the work to recover from my eating disorder and I don’t understand why I can’t just be happy. Why do I hate myself so much? Why is it so hard to eat? Why do I feel so guilty for eating? Every fucking week in therapy we talk about how food is essential and fuel for your body and then again when I see my dietitian. But I still hate myself anytime I eat. I just want to be normal. But I also feel like I’d rather just give up and let it kill me. I’d rather die of anorexia in my 20’s than feel like this for decades until I die. The only thing that keeps me going is my niece and my students. I don’t care about me. I don’t care if I’m healthy. I don’t care if I die. I care about them. But then I think that my students deserve so much better. They deserve someone who doesn’t hate themselves. Someone who doesn’t go home and make herself vomit in the shower and then sit by her bed crying with a bottle of Benadryl in her hand. I’ve had people tell me I’m going to be a great teacher but I have a hard time believing it and I just think my students and future students deserve better. I keep thinking I should give up because I’m going to fail anyway. I feel like I’m terrible at what I do even though my students are making progress. I probably have imposter syndrome because I always think I don’t actually know what I’m doing and everyone’s going to realize someday and I’ll have to quit and find a new job and be miserable. Education is my passion but I still feel like I’m not good enough. I don’t understand why I keep feeling this way and why I can’t stop. I don’t know why it’s so hard for me to listen to my therapist and do the homework she gives me. Why don’t I want to live? Why can’t I be happy with the good things in my life? Why am I so miserable? Is there any point in living if this is how I’m going to feel the rest of my life?', \"Hi guys\\n\\nI never got the hang of it when I was young. I thought I hated people and it was normal. Part of the reason I hated people was because the ones around me were not so nice (BOOHOO! ). Anyways now that I am way older (Early late 20s), I realize that I may be mentally ill. I don't like people and I am always skeptical of their true intentions. Infact I don't even like talking to people after I assume that they are not nice. Other things I do is that I worry too much, I think too much, I am often sad, I have a hard time getting along with people because I cannot trust them. \\n\\nAnd these things are making life hard.

She would say, \"Whenever you\\'re not here, I think about you and I miss you.\" Sometimes she would make this intense eye contact and gaze into my eyes for a long time and smile. She would embrace me and give me a kiss on the cheek and say,\"I miss you.\" I remember  when she would put her arms around my waist from behind and walk past me and look over and smile, giving me that look. I remember when she would eat, she would lick her spoon and look at me at the same time, like she was seducing me or something.

I don’t know when it started and it’ll probably frighten me too much to find out. I wake up every morning questioning my reality and I found myself almost dissociating as I was driving and I was scared I was gonna crash. I sometimes sit here and wonder if I put too much thought into it I might get taken away by the government for “figuring out the truth”.  I don’t know how I manage to, but I can look completely fine on the outside, but on the inside I’m screaming and tearing my hair out because I’m so so afraid of my surroundings. \\n\\nI also have moments where I don’t even recognize myself in the mirror or I somehow look different. It doesn’t help that I live with parents that think depression isn’t real and I’m probably making it up. My own mother has even laughed at me when I told her I wanted to kill myself. This is the same woman who barred me from going to therapy my senior year of high school. I guess maybe that’s why I’m going insane, I just don’t want this reality to be the real one.

So I used to hide the sharp objects, I didn’t want to even see anything, not to shave and so on bc I was really scared that I would do it, deep inside I wanted to but also was scared and I knew that it’s not right.\\n\\nAnd I think that I was quite succesful bc I guess I didn’t do it which I find really strange rn so my mind keeps coming back to the past and replaying some memories bc I can’t believe it.

I havent been diagnosed with ocd as everyone even professionals pass it off as obsessional thinking and not ocd. Recently for about 4 months straight now ive had no break from intrusive thoughts. They are about if im a psychopath narcissist sociopath sadist pedophile or the next serial killer. I wouldnt leave the house and i still wont because i know because i start to think more when i do. Last year i developed the fear of being schizophrenic or psychotic. Id start panicking thinking am i delusional or if i hear something whilst listening to music id have to rewind the music back and listen again just to check i was sane. I started imagining voices in my head to convince myself i could actually hear them. When id leave the house my mind would be like \" youre being watched\" or \"that person over there is a witch\" etc etc. \\n     \\nDay before yesterday i was talking to someone about how i wouldnt smoke weed because i dont want to be psychotic or end up schizo. And then i remembered how they have delusions and think crazy stuff(no offence). And then i had a thought i cant remember if it started with \"what if\" but anyways it was something like \" what if my parents arent my real parents and to have my real parents back i have to kill the ones im with now and then they will come and we will be together happily\" and now i wish i never even spoke about psychosis because ive made myself latch onto another thing. But now im like am i just saying that so i can convince myself im sane.\\n\\nYesterday i tried thinking rationally by looking at photos from when i was born and i will keep telling myself if they arent my real parents explain this but then id think yeah but what if they adopted me or took me when i was born. And then i keep telling myself my dad is my real dad and my mum is my real mum but im still not convinced and i actually think im being delusional but then im like what if im not delusional and im just saying that to seem sane and what if i am right that they arent my real parents.\\n\\nAnd yesterday i kept looking at my dad and thinking oh my real dad wouldnt say that or see thats not my dad but at the same time im trying to convince myself it is and ive never once questioned if they were my parents until about 2 days ago when i was talking about schizophrenia. Or im just making excuses to cover up that im insane. But when i say im delusional i dont feel delusional i feel like im right and am just saying it to convince myself im sane.\\n\\nI keep imaging in my head like to test myself ways to kill my parents and how i will then message their phone numbers and write a message saying for them both to meet me down my street and then we meet and we live happily ever after. Its like im testing myself by imagining these things to see how i react and if they sound right. Like i kept thinking my dad isnt my dad to see if it sounded right and it did and then i said my dad is my real dad and now that dont sound right.\\n\\nThese few months i did convince myself i had a list of disorders and that im a future serial killer and i had these intrusive thoughts for months. I have other things that i think make me delusional and thats i used to or still do sometimes imagine i have super powers but then im like but i do have super powers. And now im like its psychosis and then i think no its not its the truth.\\n\\nIm on anti depressants so i looked up if they caused delusions and my dad has mental health disorders but idk if ive got something from him. And then i looked up the thing im thinking and it came up with something called a capgras delusion and i was like oh great so i have that.\\n\\nIts like now im comvinced they arent my real parents and now nothing feels right anymore and idk what to do and i tell myself delusional people wouldnt question this stuff but im not sure. And i feel like im saying things to sound sane when im actually not or there is nothing wrong with me and what i think i the truth. I keep thinking ah well that explains alot that my dad isnt my real dad because my real dad would be so much nicer and same for my mum and then im like they arent my real parents so in order to have them back i must kill these ones now.\\n\\nI did once drive myself mad thinking i had depersonalization or something. So id be standing in the mirror and i will look at think how is that me? Thats someone else surely? And then i also convinced myself ive been faking my feelings the whole time and im emotionless and that i dont love my parents and it made me cry because i told my dad and he was like its fine if you dont love us but we love you and then i felt guilty. That drove me mad to the point where i wanted to be put in hospital because i was panicking and kept thinking every emotion i felt was false the whole time.\\n\\nI sometimes think oh what if ted bundy is my cat but reincarnated or something like that. Or if its a person stuck in the cat. And yesterday i was sat thinking that my dad doesnt have a clue what his daughter is thinking right now that he isnt her dad. Idk what to do because ive convinced myself its true and that they arent my real parents so i have capgras syndrome or im just lying to myself that its capgras and im covering up the truth to make me feel sane which sounds more right than the other thing.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["acc = 0\n","bcc = 0\n","for ll in sentiment_scores:\n","    print(ll)\n","    for l in ll:\n","        if l == -2:\n","            bcc += 1\n","        acc += 1\n","print(acc)\n","print(bcc)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aMGA2nNPXMU3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709522420823,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":105,"user":{"displayName":"Brian Wei","userId":"03737635291572681222"}},"outputId":"ae407e31-53c8-4689-bca8-566a39f705fc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0.8, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0.8, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 0.8, 0, 0.2, 0, -1, 0.8, 0, 0.2, 0, -1, 0.8, 0, 0.2, 0, -1, 0.8, 0, 0.2, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.9, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.9, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -0.9, 0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]\n","[-1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.95, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.95, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","[-0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0, -0.9, 0.9, 0, 0, 0]\n","500\n","0\n"]}]}]}

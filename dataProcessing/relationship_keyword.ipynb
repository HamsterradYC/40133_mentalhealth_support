This can make it feel all too normal when it has always had the stigma of being abnormal, a stigma which is luckily coming to end. When this happens, it becomes an idea of what we act like, not a real thing, just an idea. Note that this was all guesswork to an extent.\\\\n\\\\n This does not mean we should forget how real it is. If we neglect to acknowledge it as a very real problem, especially if you have a mental illness, you can forget that there is a way to improve, with enough time, and in different ways, that you can get better. This is the problem with the line of thinking that can lead you to believe it's not real. If you stop believing it's real, even if just on a subconscious level, you, in some way, lose the drive to get better, something already in worryingly short supply for many.\\\\n\\\\n I should say though, that I understand. I went through some mental illness problems for a long time, and so it began feeling less like I was experiencing a serious issue, and more that this was normal, then it felt abstract. By the time I starting feeling like it was abstract, wasn't really anything that bothered me. It was after me getting better and figuring things out, that I was able to realize how wrong I was. The dark didn't contrast with the light until after, and it felt like some non-existent thing in everyone's mind. \\\\n\\\\nI don't know how to articulate what I'm trying to say, but i think that this, for me, was that everyone's emotions and mental state became something that was semi-fantastical, and lost meaning. A blank statement, or, more accurately, a cliche. It was through my health slowly returning that I figured out how real it all was. That, I think, was my life's most important revelation.\\\\n\\\\nNot sure if I was any help, but I hope I was.

But then, thinking that doesn't change a damn thing. And that's how I know it's real. I've built up a lifetime of unhealthy thinking based on the trauma in the foundation of my childhood, of who I am. And undoing that takes time and effort. That's mental illness for me, and that's how I get back to feeling grounded and knowing it's real and that it's not something I can just like... flip a switch on. If that makes sense.

This can make it feel all too normal when it has always had the stigma of being abnormal, a stigma which is luckily coming to end. When this happens, it becomes an idea of what we act like, not a real thing, just an idea. Note that this was all guesswork to an extent.\\\\n\\\\n This does not mean we should forget how real it is. If we neglect to acknowledge it as a very real problem, especially if you have a mental illness, you can forget that there is a way to improve, with enough time, and in different ways, that you can get better. This is the problem with the line of thinking that can lead you to believe it's not real. If you stop believing it's real, even if just on a subconscious level, you, in some way, lose the drive to get better, something already in worryingly short supply for many.\\\\n\\\\n I should say though, that I understand. I went through some mental illness problems for a long time, and so it began feeling less like I was experiencing a serious issue, and more that this was normal, then it felt abstract. By the time I starting feeling like it was abstract, wasn't really anything that bothered me. It was after me getting better and figuring things out, that I was able to realize how wrong I was. The dark didn't contrast with the light until after, and it felt like some non-existent thing in everyone's mind. \\\\n\\\\nI don't know how to articulate what I'm trying to say, but i think that this, for me, was that everyone's emotions and mental state became something that was semi-fantastical, and lost meaning. A blank statement, or, more accurately, a cliche. It was through my health slowly returning that I figured out how real it all was. That, I think, was my life's most important revelation.\\\\n\\\\nNot sure if I was any help, but I hope I was.

But then, thinking that doesn't change a damn thing. And that's how I know it's real. I've built up a lifetime of unhealthy thinking based on the trauma in the foundation of my childhood, of who I am. And undoing that takes time and effort. That's mental illness for me, and that's how I get back to feeling grounded and knowing it's real and that it's not something I can just like... flip a switch on. If that makes sense.

I\\\\'m still on my own journey trying to navigate this, but it sounds like you have a lot to be proud of. Academics isn\\\\'t just \\\"one\\\" thing; it requires a lot of positive qualities: tenacity, intelligence, curiosity, focus, etc. So just think in terms of that, maybe: what qualities make you a good academic? There is definitely more than one. \\\\n\\\\nAlso, personally, I believe every human life is intrinsically worth something. It\\\\'s sometimes hard to extend that to myself when I make a mistake, but it\\\\'s compatible with my philosophy.

Even if I feel like I\\u2019m dying, I still go to work. \\n\\nPerson A: ah okay, fair enough, it\\u2019s just I really can\\u2019t function at my job when I\\u2019m under the weather because it\\u2019s a fast-paced job. \\n\\nPerson B: well, with your job you\\u2019re kind of expected to deal with it when you\\u2019re tired. \\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know if those conversations made sense, person A is just innocently stating something and then person B twists their words and uses their words to attack A and make them feel bad.

The same thing happens every time I have a crush, I like the girl I want to talk to her but I chicken out and if by some miracle I do, I make it kinda awkward and they don\\u2019t have interest and if I try dming I always get ignored or dry replies so I don\\u2019t want to do that. And because every time my crush is right there and I can talk to her but don\\u2019t or they seem really uninterested as far as not wanting to be friends it makes me sad, really sad and maybe even depressed and since all my crushes were like this I don\\u2019t like them.

You can also take the opportunity to observe other people do this so you can learn from them. I don\\\\'t know if you often have that feeling that you want to say something and then when you find the space the topic has changed and it doesn\\\\'t make sense anymore.

So ill tag your name, u/Satydog . First off, there is absolutely nothing wrong about being interested in getting to know a person. Let\\u2019s face it, a man or woman in their 30\\u2019s, they don\\u2019t get asked out as much as they used to. It\\u2019s just harder to meet interested single people at that age unless they are actively looking. You don\\u2019t have to say this, but this is the implication you want to put off\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHey, I really enjoy it whenever we hang out in the group at the dog park. I\\u2019d like to get to know you better outside of that environment, if you\\u2019re interested.\\u201d The absolute worst that could happen is she\\u2019s flattered but not interested, you continue to enjoy your interactions at the dog park, as friends.\\\\n\\\\nHell, you got somebody looking to set you up, that\\u2019s even better! This person can be the go between, find out if she\\u2019s even interested in the first place \\\\n\\\\nJust prepare yourself mentally. Ask questions, show interest. You obviously must love dogs, so do I. And she does too. There you go. \\\\n\\\\nIdk if this little story from my life will help you at all. But one time, I had this magical night with this girl. First time I \\u201cfell in love\\u201d. Did not work out in the end lol. But this magical night, we\\u2019re out on this balcony of an abandoned cabin out in Montana, looking out at the Mountains, every star in the sky.\\\\n\\\\nWe met on this 6 week field mapping camping course for my undergrad degree. 40 students from all over the country. I\\u2019m immediately struck by this girl as soon as we arrive. Took me two days to work up the courage to say anything to her. Just so happens that we have the same birthday, this coming up Monday. Weekends our time off, so we party that Friday night. But to us, we\\u2019re celebrating our birthday. My buddy who i went with, in the van on the ride back to our camp, was trying to play matchmaker cause he knows I\\u2019m into her, starts up this chant: \\u201cBirthday kiss! Birthday kiss!\\u201d Everybody\\u2019s chanting it. She gets all shy, I\\u2019m super shy, I\\u2019m just like *Nah, Nah. I preciate it man, but not like that. Not like that.*\\\\n\\\\nSo we wind up just the two of us, on this balcony. She says \\u201cI love dogs.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo kidding, I love dogs too!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cAww!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHad this dog, growing up as a kid. Duncan. My best friend. Duncan was a fox terrier and every dog breed is bred for a purpose, they have a certain instinctual personality. Most dogs, hunting dogs, working dogs, herding dogs, have it bred into them to look to the owner for guidance. Fox terriers are bred to live on a farm and be let out in the morning, and they go all over, hunting on their own. They\\u2019re very independent minded, some would say hard headed. So, anytime somebody came over and opened the door a little too wide, he would bolt out the door. Go around the neighborhood, hunting, bringing back dead squirrels, rolling in the worst smelling stuff, getting in fights, got bit by a snake one time. And I would worry and sit outside until 11:00 waiting on him to come home. One day after Thanksgiving, he came back, proud as he could be, with this enormous turkey leg in his mouth, like something from the Flintstones. Don\\u2019t know where he got that!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSo she\\u2019s laughing, she\\u2019s all engaged in this cute little story. \\u201cEvery time I hear the song Born To Run by Bruce Springsteen, I think about Duncan.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cOh I love to run!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cYea, I\\u2019ve seen you in shorts. I kinda figured!\\u201d You gotta be a little flirtatious, and complimentary, but nothing creepy. \\u201cThat\\u2019s my favorite song. Let me tell you the best line from that song: Someday girl and I don\\u2019t know when/ we\\u2019re gonna get to that place where we really wanna go/ and we\\u2019ll walk in the sun/ But until then/ Tramps like us/ Bany we were Born To Run.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAt this point, she leans up and kisses me on the cheek. Electricity, to me. So now, I\\u2019m thinking *Birthday kiss! Birthday kiss!*\\\\n\\\\nIt didn\\u2019t work out in the end, I kinda botched it all. Got my heart broken. But you live and learn, and I wouldn\\u2019t trade it for the world, if I had never put myself out there like that. Idk if that\\u2019s helpful at all, but the point is, you need to just loosen up and talk about whatever comes to mind. Open up. Easier said than done, trust me I know. But it comes with practice. Talk passionately about whatever it is you\\u2019re interested in, try to zero in on her interests and connect the two. Drop some interesting tidbits of trivia in there. Get her to talk about her interests and make her feel interesting with your responses. \\u201cReally? That\\u2019s so cool! You\\u2019re full of surprises.\\u201d I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve got some kinda cute little story about your dog or previous dogs that you can share with her. And she does too and would probably love to share it. People enjoy opening up about the things they love.\\\\n\\\\nSo, if you\\u2019re not comfortable asking her out, play it cool, get to know her, try to throw some flirtation in there. And let this matchmaker do her thing, and just be like \\u201cHey, I appreciate you trying!\\u201d If it don\\u2019t work out, oh well. You\\u2019ll never regret trying, I can guarantee that much. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe look up some YT videos on dating and talking to girls. ToddVDating has a really informative channel. It\\u2019s never too late. Just get into the mindset of \\u201cOf course I\\u2019m interested in getting to know this person. Who the hell could blame me for that? You wanna play matchmaker? Hell yeah, go right ahead.

It\\u2019s just harder to meet interested single people at that age unless they are actively looking. You don\\u2019t have to say this, but this is the implication you want to put off\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHey, I really enjoy it whenever we hang out in the group at the dog park. I\\u2019d like to get to know you better outside of that environment, if you\\u2019re interested.\\u201d The absolute worst that could happen is she\\u2019s flattered but not interested, you continue to enjoy your interactions at the dog park, as friends.\\\\n\\\\nHell, you got somebody looking to set you up, that\\u2019s even better! This person can be the go between, find out if she\\u2019s even interested in the first place \\\\n\\\\nJust prepare yourself mentally. Ask questions, show interest. You obviously must love dogs, so do I. And she does too. There you go. \\\\n\\\\nIdk if this little story from my life will help you at all. But one time, I had this magical night with this girl. First time I \\u201cfell in love\\u201d. Did not work out in the end lol. But this magical night, we\\u2019re out on this balcony of an abandoned cabin out in Montana, looking out at the Mountains, every star in the sky.\\\\n\\\\nWe met on this 6 week field mapping camping course for my undergrad degree. 40 students from all over the country. I\\u2019m immediately struck by this girl as soon as we arrive. Took me two days to work up the courage to say anything to her. Just so happens that we have the same birthday, this coming up Monday. Weekends our time off, so we party that Friday night. But to us, we\\u2019re celebrating our birthday. My buddy who i went with, in the van on the ride back to our camp, was trying to play matchmaker cause he knows I\\u2019m into her, starts up this chant: \\u201cBirthday kiss! Birthday kiss!\\u201d Everybody\\u2019s chanting it. She gets all shy, I\\u2019m super shy, I\\u2019m just like *Nah, Nah. I preciate it man, but not like that. Not like that.*\\\\n\\\\nSo we wind up just the two of us, on this balcony. She says \\u201cI love dogs.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cNo kidding, I love dogs too!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cAww!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cHad this dog, growing up as a kid. Duncan. My best friend. Duncan was a fox terrier and every dog breed is bred for a purpose, they have a certain instinctual personality. Most dogs, hunting dogs, working dogs, herding dogs, have it bred into them to look to the owner for guidance. Fox terriers are bred to live on a farm and be let out in the morning, and they go all over, hunting on their own. They\\u2019re very independent minded, some would say hard headed. So, anytime somebody came over and opened the door a little too wide, he would bolt out the door. Go around the neighborhood, hunting, bringing back dead squirrels, rolling in the worst smelling stuff, getting in fights, got bit by a snake one time. And I would worry and sit outside until 11:00 waiting on him to come home. One day after Thanksgiving, he came back, proud as he could be, with this enormous turkey leg in his mouth, like something from the Flintstones. Don\\u2019t know where he got that!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nSo she\\u2019s laughing, she\\u2019s all engaged in this cute little story. \\u201cEvery time I hear the song Born To Run by Bruce Springsteen, I think about Duncan.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cOh I love to run!\\u201d\\\\n\\\\n\\u201cYea, I\\u2019ve seen you in shorts. I kinda figured!\\u201d You gotta be a little flirtatious, and complimentary, but nothing creepy. \\u201cThat\\u2019s my favorite song. Let me tell you the best line from that song: Someday girl and I don\\u2019t know when/ we\\u2019re gonna get to that place where we really wanna go/ and we\\u2019ll walk in the sun/ But until then/ Tramps like us/ Bany we were Born To Run.\\u201d\\\\n\\\\nAt this point, she leans up and kisses me on the cheek. Electricity, to me. So now, I\\u2019m thinking *Birthday kiss! Birthday kiss!*\\\\n\\\\nIt didn\\u2019t work out in the end, I kinda botched it all. Got my heart broken. But you live and learn, and I wouldn\\u2019t trade it for the world, if I had never put myself out there like that. Idk if that\\u2019s helpful at all, but the point is, you need to just loosen up and talk about whatever comes to mind. Open up. Easier said than done, trust me I know. But it comes with practice. Talk passionately about whatever it is you\\u2019re interested in, try to zero in on her interests and connect the two. Drop some interesting tidbits of trivia in there. Get her to talk about her interests and make her feel interesting with your responses. \\u201cReally? That\\u2019s so cool! You\\u2019re full of surprises.\\u201d I\\u2019m sure you\\u2019ve got some kinda cute little story about your dog or previous dogs that you can share with her. And she does too and would probably love to share it. People enjoy opening up about the things they love.\\\\n\\\\nSo, if you\\u2019re not comfortable asking her out, play it cool, get to know her, try to throw some flirtation in there. And let this matchmaker do her thing, and just be like \\u201cHey, I appreciate you trying!\\u201d If it don\\u2019t work out, oh well. You\\u2019ll never regret trying, I can guarantee that much. \\\\n\\\\nMaybe look up some YT videos on dating and talking to girls. ToddVDating has a really informative channel. It\\u2019s never too late. Just get into the mindset of \\u201cOf course I\\u2019m interested in getting to know this person. Who the hell could blame me for that? You wanna play matchmaker? Hell yeah, go right ahead. What have I got to lose?\\u201d', 'score': 1, 'created_utc': 1568575809}]\",\n          \"[{'body': 'I wish, but im on ps4 :(', 'score': 2, 'created_utc': 1635131391}, {'body': 'If u only play csgo i would', 'score': 1, 'created_utc': 1635131640}, {'body': \\\"Hey dude.

I'll have that hospital job for four and a half years by the time I graduate. Because of those,  I also have a killer application for the undergraduate nurse jobs. It's an incredibly effective positive feedback loop. What are some sorts of jobs my girlfriend could get that feed into that same positive feedback loop, but for teaching?

The district I wanted most only has one open elementary position. I\\u2019ve applied to literally every single district in my county. I\\u2019ve managed to get on one eligibility list, which is great, but I\\u2019ve heard radio silence from almost all others. I\\u2019m coming from the private sector where job hunting isn\\u2019t this stressful. \\n\\nMy credential is currently being evaluated by my state and I\\u2019m waiting to get it before I try to apply to charter schools. I\\u2019m nervous to work for a charter school, and I want to start in a district as fast as possible. \\n\\nAnyways, I feel so happy for those I see on here getting hired. I just hope I can too.

However, today was almost too much.\\n\\nBackground: I teach Latin.  I am the only Latin teacher in the district, and I do 8-12.  This means I am at two schools.\\n\\nFor the last three years, I have had a combined 2/3 class of students so I could take an ELA class (taught that for 15).  This is the third year in a row with a new ELA prep (American Lit. this year, so I am okay with it).\\n\\nNow, the pandemic has made things interesting.  Rather than being able to use my Latin textbook from last year, which we did not come close to finishing, I am doing things virtual.  My Latin II class this year is using a program that is completely different from what I was doing.  I am scrambling like mad to scaffold, find assignments and make sure the students are successful.\\n\\nHowever, it gets even more interesting.\\n\\nI live in a rural area.  We are a Title 1 school.  A large number of my students lack home Internet and are being sent home to quarantine.  I have to compile work assignments for students in a class I know nothing about that is 100 percent virtual.  This includes all vocabulary, exercises, grammatical forms and the like.\\n\\nIt gets MORE interesting.\\n\\nParents are deciding to pull their kids out and keep them at home.  Some, fortunately, have Internet.  These I am not overly concerned with.  However, those who are pulled out indefinitely will need a constant stream of work sent home, completed and returned. \\n\\nWhen a student is pulled out of school, they are changed on my rosters.  In two classes, I have eight, yes, eight, different rosters that seem to change daily.  When a student is put back into school, they go on a roster.  I have to find and manually move grades over.\\n\\nThe MOST interesting part of the whole ordeal.\\n\\nI am at two schools.  I have one planning period for travel, lunch and planning.  The drive is not bad &gt;10 minutes. \\n\\nSo, in my brief time that I have for planning, I have to:\\n\\n1. Prepare ahead for four preparations;\\n2. Plan for remote learners and in person learners;\\n3. Set up Google meets and times;\\n4. Collect, and grade work for learners without home Internet;\\n5. Keep up with grades from continually shifting rosters;\\n6. Call parents about students with failing grades;\\n7. And all of the other fun documentation that I do!\\n\\nAnyway, I really did not want to vent, but today, along with today being my mother's birthday, whom I lost in May to the virus, was just a bit much.\\n\\nThanks for reading.  I promise to return to being supportive later.\\n\\nUpdate: My evaluation admin, former World Language teacher and buddy, stopped by this a.m. to inquire about me.\\n\\nI let it all out.  Including, as I forgot to day yesterday, the continuous drop of connectivity I have on the classroom computer.\\n\\nShe was very sympathetic and noted the system we have in place was designed around approximately 300 students.  That number is 750+ and changing constantly.\\n\\nA change, for the better, is on the horizon.  This will ameliorate considerable stress for me and allow an opportunity to get ahead.\\n\\nThank you all, again, for your kind words of support.  This is how it should be - lifting up and supporting.\\n\\nI will return to my supportive role anon.\",\n          \"Hello all!

She was frustrated with her curriculum and started asking her students meta-questions to gauge how well she was doing. The answer: terrible. This is a good thing, because now she knows there's a problem and can correct it. She did this before a graded assignment, and got a lot more information from it. \\n\\nThis leads me to two questions: \\n\\n1. From the outside (having recently escaped college), the industry looks bloated, tired, running on an ineffective treadmill making the same mistakes over and over again. This may or may not be justified, so I'd like to hear from anyone closer to the action. Has anyone ever tried applying lean manufacturing techniques* to education?\\n\\n2. Teachers have a better grasp of what their classroom needs than distant textbook authors, granted. I did some cursory googling and found resources for elementary teachers that look like they were designed for elementary students. Is there a resource more like a GitHub for education: where teachers can share insights, techniques, and anecdotes freely?\\n\\n2b.

She was frustrated with her curriculum and started asking her students meta-questions to gauge how well she was doing. The answer: terrible. This is a good thing, because now she knows there's a problem and can correct it. She did this before a graded assignment, and got a lot more information from it. \\n\\nThis leads me to two questions: \\n\\n1.

This may or may not be justified, so I'd like to hear from anyone closer to the action. Has anyone ever tried applying lean manufacturing techniques* to education?\\n\\n2. Teachers have a better grasp of what their classroom needs than distant textbook authors, granted. I did some cursory googling and found resources for elementary teachers that look like they were designed for elementary students. Is there a resource more like a GitHub for education: where teachers can share insights, techniques, and anecdotes freely?\\n\\n2b.

I would have been gone long ago.\\\", 'score': 1, 'created_utc': 1635344677}]\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"contains_relational_word\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_teaching_sample1 = df_teaching_sample['contains_relational_word'].sum()\n","df_teaching_sample0 = (df_teaching_sample['contains_relational_word'] == 0).sum()\n","\n","teaching_proportion_1 = df_teaching_sample1 / len(df_teaching_sample)\n","\n","print(f\"Count of 1: {df_teaching_sample1}\")\n","print(f\"Count of 0: {df_teaching_sample0}\")\n","print(f\"Proportion of 1: {teaching_proportion_1:.2f}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709588922298,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":100,"user":{"displayName":"Yuxuan Cai","userId":"11711515420560191178"}},"outputId":"e7b07c0d-a240-4465-e4a9-b997032e7b7f","id":"TbBch3SpbnEJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Count of 1: 5560\n","Count of 0: 4440\n","Proportion of 1: 0.56\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# df_mental_illness_sample.to_csv('df_mental_illness_sample_20000.csv', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"1U8NW4qcbnEJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["teaching_out_file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/MACSS60000/FINAL_DATA/mental_health_csv/teaching_processed.csv'\n","\n","df_teaching_sample.to_csv(teaching_out_file_path, index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"KDO_cuilbnEJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["readdf_teaching = pd.read_csv(teaching_out_file_path)\n","readdf_teaching.shape"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709588951920,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":610,"user":{"displayName":"Yuxuan Cai","userId":"11711515420560191178"}},"outputId":"ca1c12af-8b25-4ac7-cde5-a07242a07c8b","id":"bX7tHuKfbnEJ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["(10000, 6)"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":26}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# csv_files = glob.glob(os.path.join(control_directory_path, \"*.csv\"))\n","\n","# for csv_file in csv_files:\n","#     df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)\n","#     df_cleaned = df.dropna(subset=['selftext'])\n","#     df_cleaned = df_cleaned[df_cleaned['selftext'] != '[deleted]']\n","\n","#     if len(df_cleaned) > 10000:\n","#         df_sample = df_cleaned.sample(n=10000, random_state=42)\n","#     else:\n","#         df_sample = df_cleaned\n","\n","#     df_sample['contains_relational_word'] = df_sample['selftext'].apply(contains_relational_word)\n","#     count_of_1 = df_sample['contains_relational_word'].sum()\n","#     count_of_0 = (df_sample['contains_relational_word'] == 0).sum()\n","#     proportion = count_of_1 / len(df_sample)\n","\n","#     print(f\"File: {os.path.basename(csv_file)} - Count of 1: {count_of_1}, Count of 0: {count_of_0}, Proportion of relational words: {proportion:.2f}\")\n","#     output_file_path = csv_file.replace('.csv', '_processed.csv')\n","#     df_sample.to_csv(output_file_path, index=False)\n","#     print(f\"Processed file saved to: {output_file_path}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"RiedxMBBYA0f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709508793877,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":136647,"user":{"displayName":"Yuxuan Cai","userId":"11711515420560191178"}},"outputId":"dddc010d-922b-4b44-fd4d-40758ec4fe16"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["File: teaching.csv - Count of 1: 5659, Count of 0: 4341, Proportion of relational words: 0.57\n","Processed file saved to: /content/drive/MyDrive/MACSS60000/FINAL_DATA/control_group_csv/teaching_processed.csv\n","File: random_kindness.csv - Count of 1: 1658, Count of 0: 8342, Proportion of relational words: 0.17\n","Processed file saved to: /content/drive/MyDrive/MACSS60000/FINAL_DATA/control_group_csv/random_kindness_processed.csv\n","File: tales_from_retail.csv - Count of 1: 5061, Count of 0: 4939, Proportion of relational words: 0.51\n","Processed file saved to: /content/drive/MyDrive/MACSS60000/FINAL_DATA/control_group_csv/tales_from_retail_processed.csv\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-10-0da16070b967>:7: DtypeWarning: Columns (3) have mixed types.

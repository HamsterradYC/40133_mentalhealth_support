This is my first time posting so sorry for any mistakes or if this isn't the correct place to post this. I am in college to be a Secondary Educator, I'm thinking high school, and have lots of ideas that I'm sure will be shot down once I start student teaching. But one of the things that was lacking in my school and that we all discuss when talking about teaching is that there was no real world lessons ever taught to us. Such as \\\"What's a mortgage?\\\" Or \\\"How does a credit line or loans work? How will this effect you choices?\\\" I do not want to teach in Mathematics but there are things that students aren't getting out of the classroom when they leave to the world. We also know that many parents aren't helpful in this area either. So for my question..\\n\\nIs it possible to put in your/a lesson plan/weekly plan, maybe once a week for 20 minutes, time to teach students something like this, regardless of the subject you teach? Has anyone done this and was it successful or how did it fail? \",\n          \"Hi, a fellow student from Singapore.   \\n\\n\\nI am currently preparing for an interview to become a student teacher with a chance of a scholarship.   \\nMy lesson is around upper secondary school students (15-16 years old) in Chemistry.  \\n\\n\\nI was wondering what resources I can tap into to help me in my preparations. \\n\\nI would love to also see more videos of examples of good 5 min lessons that I can study\\n\\nEdit: For this trial lesson, I can't use technology so it's plain paper, props and white board\",\n          \"Hi, I\\u2019m not a teacher. But I have a cool idea if I was, and maybe you could try it. Basically if I taught an English class, I would let my students turn in a short story, ten pages, double space and 14 p font, for extra credit once a semester. One story per student. It would need to have a certain level of quality, not professional writer-like, but just enough that I know they put effort into it and didn\\u2019t throw it together in one night for the grade. At the end of the year, I\\u2019d put them all together, and self publish all of the stories. I\\u2019d get each students consent for their inclusion, of course. I\\u2019d do this every year, and give the funds from the books to the school. Is this something that would be allowed? Because I\\u2019d love to see it happen.
